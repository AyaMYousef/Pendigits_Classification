# Decision Tree and Ensemble Methods for Digit Classification

This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning algorithms for digit classification using the Pendigits dataset. The focus is on Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forests, AdaBoost, and XGBoost models. The goal is to classify handwritten digits based on their pixel data.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of:
  - pendigits-train.csv: Training data.
  - pendigits-test.csv: Test data.
    
Each sample represents a handwritten digit and is characterized by pixel values, with the target variable being the digit itself.

# Requirements
 To run this project, you need to have the following Python packages installed:
  - pandas
  - seaborn
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - graphviz
  - xgboost
